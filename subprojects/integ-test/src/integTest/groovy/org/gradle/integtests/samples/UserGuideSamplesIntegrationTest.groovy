    Important info:

     If you're working in samples area there're gradle tasks that you should know of:
     - gradle intTestImage makes sure that the samples' resources are copied to the right place
     - gradle docs:userguideDocbook makes sure that samples' info is extracted from XMLs
     - the 'expected' content of the asserting mechanism lives under docs/src/samples/userguideOutput
     - Running:
        ./gradlew intTestImage docs:userguide integtest:integTest -DintegTest.single=UserGuideSamplesIntegrationTest

     Samples are not tested by default. For a sample to be executed and tested, you need to:
     - add a nested <output/> tag to the <sample/> tag
     - use the `args` parameter of the output tag to specify the tasks to be executed
     - optionally set the name of the reference output file (by default, will use [sample id].out)
